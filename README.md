### A lightweight blogging theme for AnchorCMS

This is a theme for [AnchorCMS](http://anchorcms.com). It is ready and willing to please.

[Download the zip](https://github.com/joshkennedy/joshkennedy-dot-me/zipball/master)

Have fun.

### Things you'll probably want to change:

- Twitter username (found in `js/main.js`)
- Google Analytics code (found in `header.php`)
- MediaTemple affiliate link - unless you'd like to help a brother out. Bills to pay and whatnot. You can find that in `footer.php`
- Disqus embed (found in `comment_form.php`) [AnchorCMS comes with its own comments functionality, so you'll need to grab that from the default theme]
- Dribbble feed username - found in `header.php`
